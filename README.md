(The codebase really is bullsh*t - My subjective opinion)_**

<h1></h1>

- Redesigned the model cards in the browser to give them a modern look :3
- Added badges to model cards to display model type and NSFW status (if applicable).</br>
  _Note: Badges are only visible when `Tile Size` is set to 12 or higher._
- Model cards that require purchase are marked in gold.</br>
  _Note: The model type badge turns gold and displays a lightning icon :3_
- Implemented optional setting to change the resolution of model previews (Customize to your liking in settings - `Browser`).
- All CSS and JS files have been formatted using Prettier for consistent code style.
- Implemented encryption of image previews when images are saved (For Kaggle Only!).</br>
  _Note: The [Encrypt-Image](https://github.com/anxety-solo/sd-encrypt-image) extension must be installed to enable this feature._
